# Changelog for QGIS 3.42 {#changelog342}

![](images/projects/b5beabaeef257557086b43ccdceffed3c78d8676.png.webp)

Release date: 2025-02-21

The QGIS Project proudly announces the release of QGIS 3.42, a significant step forward in the development of Free and Open Source Geospatial Information Systems. This release builds upon the solid foundations of previous releases while introducing exciting new features and enhancements that will streamline workflows and empower users in their spatial analysis endeavors.

Notable enhancements have been introduced for features that move beyond the traditional map frame, such as various aspects of 3D Map Views, plots and profiles, as well as a new Virtual Point Cloud overview widget for improved navigation across complex datasets. Greater control is provided for cartographic functionality, such as CSS-based label properties and extensions to the Python API, while advanced data types such as Mesh and Point Clouds have also seen their fair share of improvements.

A new set of Metadata Tools has been added to the Processing toolbox (along with various other new additions and enhancements), whilst a new feature will allow users to label Pixels on Raster data. Layout tools have not been forgotten, and the QGIS Python console also has a new interactive help feature with direct integration with project documentation sources for an enhanced developer experience.

For a whirlwind tour of all the new functionalities introduced, you can view the [highlight reel video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6Ejov4u7xk).

## Symbology 

### Feature: Add configurable extent buffer to symbols

In previous versions of QGIS, only features located within the canvas extent were considered for rendering under certain conditions.

This would cause issues with certain symbologies, especially when using complex geometry generators, as users would not see features where the rendered symbol might have appeared within the canvas but the source feature does not.

For example, if using a point feature to generate a buffer polygon such as `buffer(@geometry, 7)`, the buffer would not render if the point was not within the canvas extent.

A new configuration option for symbols allows for a buffer of the canvas extent to envelope these additional features within the user-defined constraints and balance performance with complex data visualization requirements.

This feature was funded by the National Land Survey of Finland.

This feature was developed by [Juho Ervasti](https://github.com/JuhoErvasti)

## Labelling 

### Feature: Raster labeling

QGIS now allows raster pixels to be labeled with the value taken from a raster band. Labels are registered with the labeling engine, and so will participate in label conflict resolution and overlap avoidance. Options include:

-   Selection of band to take values from
-   Using QgsNumericFormat to customize the number format for the labels
-   Uses text renderer, so supports buffers, shadows, etc
-   Label priority
-   Scale dependant visibility
-   Optional pixel size dependent visibility, i.e. show only when pixels are &gt; 4mm in size
-   Z index control, overlap avoidance mode
-   Option for showing values resampled over neighboring pixels

This feature was funded by Canton de Neuch√¢tel

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson](https://github.com/nyalldawson)

### Feature: Custom tab distances for labels

Allows setting a list of custom tab stop distances on labels, instead of just a single distance This allows different thresholds to be used between breaks.

This feature was funded by City of Freiburg im Breisgau

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson](https://github.com/nyalldawson)

### Feature: Support CSS background property in labels/text renderer

QGIS now supports CSS background-color and background-image properties when used with HTML labels.

-   Backgrounds are supported for block items (e.g. `<div>`) or inline items (e.g. `<span>`)
-   For images, the CSS should be formatted as background-image: url(xx). It supports local file paths, http links, or base64 embedded content
-   Backgrounds are not supported for curved text
-   HTML backgrounds are always rendered above any background shape for the label, and below drop shadows/buffers

This feature was funded by City of Freiburg im Breisgau

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson](https://github.com/nyalldawson)

### Feature: Support CSS margins for block elements in HTML labels

QGIS has added support for CSS margin properties on block elements in the text renderer. Specifically:

-   This is available for block-type elements only, e.g. DIV, P, H1-H6.
-   Margins are NOT available for spans or other non-block content (due to Qt limitations)
-   Margins can be specified in pt units only
-   Margins can be specified either via "margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 10pt" etc, or "margin: 5pt 0pt 10pt 0pt"
-   Negative margins are supported for the bottom margin ONLY (due to Qt limitations)

This feature was funded by City of Freiburg im Breisgau

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson](https://github.com/nyalldawson)

### Feature: Support CSS line-height in HTML labels

QGIS has added support for the line-height CSS property in HTML formatted labels.

Supports line-height in either points or percent, e.g. "line-height: 40pt" or "line-height: 40%"

This feature was funded by City of Freiburg im Breisgau

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson](https://github.com/nyalldawson)

## Mesh 

### Feature: Mesh Render Extent Settings

The renderer setting for Mesh now includes an option for setting the Min/Max limits of the Color Ramp renderer based on the current canvas extent. This can be locked to a specific canvas instance or changed based on the active canvas using the same rendering behaviors as Raster Layers.

This feature was developed by [Jan Caha](https://github.com/JanCaha)

### Feature: Mesh editing delaunay refinement

Mesh editing now includes a new Delaunay refinement option. When adding a vertex to a mesh face, this feature allows for the automatic refinement of neighboring triangular faces. The algorithm checks if the edges of these adjacent faces meet the Delaunay condition, and if not, it automatically flips the edges to improve the mesh quality.

This feature was developed by [Jan Caha](https://github.com/JanCaha)

### Feature: Dataset group controls for mesh layers

Mesh layers now offer more flexible dataset group management. Users can add dataset groups with the same name (though not from the same URI) to a mesh layer. To avoid confusion, these duplicate names will be automatically appended with a number (e.g., "Original Name\_1").

Additionally, users can now remove dataset groups from a mesh layer, however, only added dataset groups (those not associated with the original mesh source file) can be removed, preventing accidental deletion of core data.

This feature was developed by [Jan Caha](https://github.com/JanCaha)

### Feature: Mesh selection actions

Two new actions have been added for selecting vertices on Mesh layers, namely:

-   select isolated vertices that are not part of any face
-   select all vertices from mesh layer

This allows users more control over the selection criteria of specific vertices.

![](images/entries/537402aa2d62c6db821d0f6eea457785adfbfc86.webp)

This feature was developed by [Jan Caha](https://github.com/JanCaha)

### Feature: Elevation assignment modes for added mesh vertices

The "Digitize Mesh Element" tool has an additional menu that allows users to select which method to utilize for the assignment of Z values on newly created vertices. New options include:

-   Prefer Mesh, then Z Widget (interpolates z value from mesh if a vertex is inside face of mesh, otherwise uses Z widget value)
-   Prefer Mesh, then Terrain (interpolates z value from mesh if a vertex is inside face of mesh, otherwise uses terrain value)
-   Project Terrain (always uses project terrain Z value)
-   Z Widget (always get Z values from widget)

The "Transform Mesh Vertices" panel also has a new button added that allows users to set the Z value of selected vertices from inferred values based on the project terrain settings.

## 3D Features 

### Feature: Debug widget for 3D views

A new debug side panel for 3D Map Views moves all relevant debug settings into a single location.

![](images/entries/b676f80f03eeac81a44dd5d95c21a1dd1d968d42.webp)

This feature was developed by [Matej Bagar](https://github.com/Withalion)

## Point Clouds 

### Feature: Virtual point cloud overviews in 2D

The default behavior of VPC rendering has been changed so that an overview is rendered when present and alternatively extents are rendered when zooming out. Layer configuration via the styling panel provides advanced control over the user-preferred behavior, allowing users to seamlessly switch between rendering just the extents, just the overview, or a combination of the two.

![](images/entries/76df45b4beff919f1428f39e13370c5bd48facb1.png.webp)

This feature was funded by Klimadatastyrelsen

This feature was developed by [Matej Bagar](https://github.com/Withalion)

## Print Layouts 

### Feature: Double-clicking a mouse handle for a layout label resizes to fit text

Double-clicking a handle will auto-size the label to fit exactly within the contained text (growing or shrinking as needed). The opposite side of the label will remain fixed in place so that, for example, double-clicking the bottom-right handle causes the bottom-right corner of the label to move.

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson](https://github.com/nyalldawson)

### Feature: Action on double click layout item

The QGIS API has been extended to add an event to Print Layout elements that are double-clicked, allowing for more advanced functionalities to be introduced in the future (e.g. double-click to edit an item).

This feature was developed by [Yoann Quenach de Quivillic](https://github.com/YoannQDQ)

### Feature: Layout better node item creation

When digitizing shapes with layout tools, the behavior has been modified to align better with the existing user experience in digitizing tools, which allows users the ability to remove incorrectly captured vertices on their shapes.

This feature was funded by Consorzio della Bonifica Renana

This feature was developed by [Alessandro Pasotti](https://github.com/elpaso)

### Feature: Copy and paste widget configuration when designing forms

A context menu has been added to the `Available Widgets` panel in the vector layer properties dialog, allowing users to copy & paste widget configurations between fields of the same layer, between fields from different layers in the QGIS project, or between fields from layers in different QGIS instances.

![Copy and paste context menu](images/entries/copy_paste_widget_configuration.png)

This feature was funded by Ville de Pully (Switzerland)

This feature was developed by [Germ√°n Carrillo](https://github.com/gacarrillor)

## Processing 

### Feature: Processing metadata tools

New native algorithms have been added to the processing toolbox for better handling of layer metadata.

-   Copy layer metadata to copy metadata from an input layer to a target layer
-   Apply layer metadata to set layer metadata from a QMD file
-   Export layer metadata to export layer metadata in a QMD file
-   Add history metadata to add a new history entry to existing entries defined for a layer
-   Update layer metadata to copy non-empty metadata fields from the input layer to a target layer and keep empty fields from input unchanged in the target
-   Set metadata fields to set simple metadata fields (identifier, parent identifier, title, type, encoding, language, CRS, abstract, fees)

![](images/entries/a61da0150028588dafa6e2fb98c0f71d628bdd29.png.webp)

This feature was developed by [Alexander Bruy](https://github.com/alexbruy)

### Feature: Expression based hover content in Scatterplots

New options for the Vector layer scatterplot processing algorithm allow users to optionally add text shown on hover using QGIS expressions.

![](images/entries/43b93ee8f5a7632654207f5d31345ea9a66ec538.webp)

This feature was developed by [Florian Neukirchen](https://github.com/florianneukirchen)

### Feature: Add option to include 'layer' and 'path' attributes in Merge Vector Layers tool

A new checkbox option has been added to the Merge Vector Layers processing tool. This option allows users to choose whether to include the layer and path attributes from the individual input vector layers in the resulting merged layer. By default, this option is enabled to maintain backward compatibility.

This feature was developed by [Nass](https://github.com/lanckmann)

### Feature: Move Geometry Checker into processing tools

In line with the objectives of [QEP\#236](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/236), which seeks to align and unify all geometry and topology verification/ validation methods, the Geometry Checker has now been integrated into the QGIS Processing Toolbox.

These algorithms have been added to the "Check Geometry" and "Fix Geometry" categories accordingly, and each algorithm maintains a consistent experience having a single input layer and two output layers.

For check processing algorithms, the outputs are:

-   a layer of the same type as the input layer with erroneous geometries only
-   a point layer with the error locations and information (feature id, part, and vertex number, etc.)

For fix processing algorithms, the outputs are:

-   a fixed layer of the same type as the input layer with corrected features according to the the chosen method
-   a point layer with the error locations and a report about the fix (fixed or not, and a message about the processed feature)

![](images/entries/f1b235d2feb5b4fe396603fc0f0bbc039f9321fd.png.webp)

This feature was funded by QGIS (Grant OpenSource 2023) and Oslandia

This feature was developed by [Jacky Volpes](https://github.com/Djedouas)

### Feature: Add title, axis titles, and logarithmic axes to plots

Plotting algorithms in the "Plots" section of the Processing Tools have been extended with new functionalities.

The Scatterplot, Barplot, and Boxplot algorithms now allow for the specification of plot titles as well as axis titles as optional parameters, If axis titles are empty, the name of the field is used as the axis title by default.

If a single space is entered, the axis title is not shown (restoring the current behavior).

Scatterplots now also support using logarithmic scales across either axis.

This feature was developed by [Florian Neukirchen](https://github.com/florianneukirchen)

### Feature: Raster zonal min/max algorithm

A new algorithm has been added that extracts point features corresponding to the minimum and maximum pixel values contained within polygon zones.

The output will contain one point feature for the minimum and one for the maximum raster value for every individual zonal feature from a polygon layer.

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson](https://github.com/nyalldawson)

### Feature: Algorithm to extract min/max pixel from raster

A new algorithm has been added that extracts extrema (minimum and maximum) values from a given band of the input raster layer.

The output is a vector layer containing point features for the selected extrema, at the center of the associated pixel.

If multiple pixels in the raster share the minimum or maximum value, then only one of these pixels will be included in the output.

The algorithm uses raster iterator to remain efficient on huge rasters, and does not require reading the entire raster to memory

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson](https://github.com/nyalldawson)

### Feature: New algorithm to generate elevation profile images

A new processing algorithm has been created which allows users to generate elevation profile images. This can effectively be used within models and will allows users to efficiently output elevation profiles for multiple curves.

This feature was developed by [Jan Caha](https://github.com/JanCaha)

## Profile Plots 

### Feature: Introduce custom tolerance for vector layers

Users can define a custom tolerance by adding a `custom tolerance` property to the layer elevation properties. When set, this will override the global tolerance parameter defined in the elevation profile widget.

![](images/entries/235450d3d9a4e73de42c567c3fc7120b31b5185f.webp)

This feature was developed by [Jean Felder](https://github.com/ptitjano)

## Data Providers 

### Feature: Execute SQL from layer context menu

Users can now execute SQL directly across supported layers from within the projects table of contents.

### Feature: Postgres raster provider - save raster style db

This PR allows saving raster styles in PostGIS database.

This feature was funded by  Ocean Winds.

This feature was developed by [Jan Caha](https://github.com/JanCaha)

### Feature: PostgreSQL/PostGIS data provider - hide raster overviews

Ads option to PostGIS Connection to not list raster overview tables from Browser. The list of raster overviews tables is obtained from PostGIS view raster_overviews.

This feature was developed by [Jan Caha](https://github.com/JanCaha)

## Programmability 

### Feature: Expose QgsGeos class to PyQGIS

GEOS-specific functionality which is not exposed through the base QgsGeometryEngine class is now directly accessible via the new QgsGeos class.

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson](https://github.com/nyalldawson)

### Feature: Make Z and M values accessible via QgsGeometry.as\_numpy()

In previous versions of QGIS, the `QgsGeometry.as_numpy()` method would return coordinates with XY values only.

In this release `as_numpy` has been modified so that the coordinates for geometries with z and/or m values will be returned as xyz, xym, or xyzm accordingly.

This feature was developed by [Till Frankenbach](https://github.com/merydian)

### Feature: Python console interactive help

When pressing F1 within the Python Console, QGIS will automatically open the API page matching:

-   selected text if any OR
-   word at the mouse position (if enabled in settings, see below) OR
-   word at the text cursor position

The documentation will be opened within the new documentation section that has been added to the Debugging and Development tools panel so that developers can have easy access to the API documentation for current code objects directly within the application.

Additional QGIS settings have also been added so that developers can more readily modify this behavior to suit their workflow.
