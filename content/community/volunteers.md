# Volunteer Contributors 🌟

This page celebrates the people who generously give their time and skills to help our project grow.  
Here, you’ll find a list of our volunteer contributors, grouped into:

- **Regular contributors 🏅** – community members who contribute on an ongoing basis.  
- **Occasional contributors 🎉** – individuals who contribute from time to time, such as during events, meetings, or for specific tasks.  

Each entry may include a short description of their role and a link to their personal website or profile for those who wish to share more about their work.

Our community flourishes because of the dedication of these volunteers. If you contribute to our project, you’re invited to add yourself to this list by editing the page on GitHub and submitting a pull request (see the link below).
