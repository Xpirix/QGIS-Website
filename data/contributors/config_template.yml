# Configuration file for contribution scoring and level thresholds
# Used to determine "level" (0–5) for each thematic area
# Levels are assigned by comparing raw contributions against thresholds.
# Example: if documentation contributions = 25 → Level 2 (since 11–50 maps to Level 2)

levels:
  documentation:                # Contributions to QGIS-Documentation repo
    # Thresholds correspond to: [Level 0 max, Level 1 max, Level 2 max, Level 3 max, Level 4 max]
    thresholds: [0, 10, 50, 200, 500]
    # Interpretation: 
    #   0        → Level 0
    #   1–10     → Level 1
    #   11–50    → Level 2
    #   51–200   → Level 3
    #   201–500  → Level 4
    #   >500     → Level 5
